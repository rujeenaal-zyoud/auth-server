# auth-Bearer


### Description :
the next stage of auth using bearer and basic using jwt

Restricting access to information online is one of the foundational paradigms of the internet. Whether it's your online bank account, facebook profile, or a one-time viewing of a document to sign, getting "logged in" to a website is an everyday activity for almost every internet user.
